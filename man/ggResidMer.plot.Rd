\usage{
ggResidMer.plot(model, id = 5, type = "pearson")
}
\description{
Plot the standardized residuals
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{ a model of class \code{merMod} or \code{glmerMod} }
\item{id}{ an optional numeric value, or one-sided formula. If given as a value, it is used as a significance level for a two-sided outlier test for the standardized, or normalized residuals. Observations with absolute standardized (normalized) residuals greater than the 1-value/2 quantile of the standard normal distribution are identified in the plot using idLabels. If given as a one-sided formula, its right hand side must evaluate to a logical, integer, or character vector which is used to identify observations in the plot. If missing, no observations are identified. }
\item{vars}{ either a character vector of predictor column names or a numeric vector of column indices. }

data(brown_genitives)

## plot the percentages of s- vs. of-genitives by
## genre, possessor animacy, and final sibilancy
ggPredictor.plot(brown_genitives, "Type",
	c("Genre", "PossrAnimacyBin", "FinalSibilant"))

## same thing using column indices:
ggPredictor.plot(brown_genitives, "Type", c(3, 19, 10))
